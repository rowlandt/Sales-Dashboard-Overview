The KPIs look at whether the total sales, total profits, and total quantity trend positively or negatively. 

Superstore sells furniture, office supplies, and technology to consumers, corporate, and home offices throughout the United States. Sales data range from 2019 to 2022. 

To track the performance of Superstore a dashboard was designed to visualize an overview of Superstore total sales, total profits, total quantity growth from year to year to see if goals are being met. 

An Excel file was uploaded into Tableau where all data analysis was conducted and was able to create an interactive Tableau dashboard. 

* An inner join was used to join both the Orders People tables.
* Created calculated fields using Level-of-Detail, CASE statements, and aggregated functions.
* Uploaded and joined hex file to obtain maps. 
* Used parameters and filters to make dashboard dynamic and interactive. 
* Button at the top right allows you to switch between dark and light mode. 
* Filter button at top right allows you to filter visualization.  


Through this analysis Superstore was overall able to see that both sales and profits have increased. Some months did see a decrease in sales and profits between the current year and previous year. A deeper dive into those months to see why sales decreased, paying attention to what segments and what products also decreased in that time can help management figure out how to improve sales. 

The Executive Board and managers will be able to see the average sale, profit, and quantity from January to December for each segment, category, location and region.
