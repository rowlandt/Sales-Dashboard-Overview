SITUATION 

Superstore sells furniture, office supplies, and technology to consumers, corporate, and home offices throughout the United States. Sales data range from 2019 to 2022. 


TASK

To track the performance of Superstore a dashboard was designed to visualize an overview of Superstore total sales, total profits, total quantity growth from year to year to see if goals are being met.
